    <p>On turning down the chance to play Richard Gere's character in the Harvey Weinstein-produced film "Chicago": I thought I was too young for the role. You have some 34-year-old guy up against Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ren√©e Zellweger and it becomes a different movie. At one point, Harvey was telling me they were thinking of Kevin Spacey, and Ivtold him, 'That's exactly right. You should hire him.' Then I was in New York when the movie opened and the queue was around the block. I sat down and thought that I had probably made the biggest mistake. But I still honestly think that it was the right thing to do. I still think I was too young for that part.</p>

<p>Finally something my family can be proud of.</p>

<p>Now I meet people with full-color Wolverine tattoos on their backs. Thank God I did okay, because I think if I handn't, they'd spit on me in the street. - on his role of Wolverine.</p>

<p>There is something very secretive about the way they cast that role. I've never had an official call asking: 'Are you interested or not?' but there's no guy I know who wouldn't want that role -- and that includes me. Anyone who says otherwise is lying. [on the now (Nov. 2004) opened spot for the next James Bond]</p>

<p>[on comic books] I never read comics as a kid, and when I was slipped the comics under my trailer door, Bryan Singer didn't want us to read them. He was very frightened that we would come out with these 2-D characters, and I was amazed at how helpful they were, the images more than the story. The images, and how they capture emotion or an action sequence in just, say, three images. I have to say I used them as inspiration for some of the fighting stances or techniques. The way Wolverine stands and how he looks.</p>

<p>
<p>
<p>[on playing Wolverine] The character I play is actually only 1.6 meters [5' 3"]. Before I had any kind of acting profile I was encouraged to lie about my height. I was told to say I was about six foot [1.83 meters] tall. I was worried about it when I first had my audition because pleasing fans of the franchise is important. My height was brought up on the Internet. They didn't think it was right. A lot of people who never met me think I'm very short. James Marsden (Cyclops), who's only 10 centimeters [4 inches] shorter than me, was put on boxes and platforms in our scenes together. You'll notice that every character in "X-Men" looks taller than me.</p>
