        <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>
          In 2010, I wanted to define what community meant in my own community.  I saw that everyone I know was already in my community, yet they did not truly know - perhaps even - not care to know much about each other.  We were part of one church going through the motions of shyly greeting one another and moving on with our dayily lives.
